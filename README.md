#FM-radio-scripts

## What is it?

This script dumps a log from FM radio: frequency & RDS (PI, PS, RT) and shows a toast message with new received PI code.  
It is necessary to have toast application installed from here:

I use version without a drawer icon.  
Don't worry, this app seem to be safe (but you have to enable installing form unknown sources to install it):

This script succesfully works on Sony Ericsson Xperia Mini Pro with CyanogenMod 9.
